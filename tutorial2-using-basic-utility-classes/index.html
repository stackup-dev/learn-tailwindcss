          Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold italic"> powerful CSS
          framework </span>that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes
          that can be used to quickly and easily style HTML elements. The
          framework is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers
          to easily create custom styles and layouts
          without having to write CSS from scratch.

          One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
          consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
          can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
          ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
          <span class="font-bold"> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          Examples of such utility classes includes the
          <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
          while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
          gray background color to an element.
        </p>
